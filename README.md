## Overview ##
Project Paws utilizes the [Petfinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs/ "Petfinder API Docs") to allow users to search for adoptable dogs, local shelters, or to meet a random doggy friend. Project Paws is my first capstone project for Thinkful's Flex Web Development Bootcamp.
